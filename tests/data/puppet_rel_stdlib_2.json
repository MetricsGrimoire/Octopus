This interacts badly\n  with the pattern of composing complex modules from smaller classes, as it\n  makes it impossible for end users to specify order relationships between the\n  exterior class and other modules.\n\n  The anchor type lets you work around this. By sandwiching any interior\n  classes between two no-op resources that _are_ contained by the exterior\n  class, you can ensure that all resources in the module are contained.\n\n      class ntp {\n        # These classes will have the correct order relationship with each\n        # other. However, without anchors, they won't have any order\n        # relationship to Class['ntp'].\n        class { 'ntp::package': }\n        -> class { 'ntp::config': }\n        -> class { 'ntp::service': }\n\n        # These two resources \"anchor\" the composed classes within the ntp\n        # class.\n        anchor { 'ntp::begin': } -> Class['ntp::package']\n        Class['ntp::service']    -> anchor { 'ntp::end': }\n      }\n\n  This allows the end user of the ntp module to establish require and before\n  relationships with Class['ntp']:\n\n      class { 'ntp': } -> class { 'mcollective': }\n      class { 'mcollective': } -> class { 'ntp': }\n\n",

This modules will include the following additions to Puppet</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stages</li>\n<li>Facts</li>\n<li>Functions</li>\n<li>Defined resource types</li>\n<li>Types</li>\n<li>Providers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This module is officially curated and provided by Puppet Labs.  The modules\nPuppet Labs writes and distributes will make heavy use of this standard\nlibrary.</p>\n\n<h1>Versions</h1>\n\n<p>This module follows semver.org (v1.0.0) versioning guidelines.  The standard\nlibrary module is released as part of <a href=\"http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-enterprise/\">Puppet\nEnterprise</a> and as a result\nolder versions of Puppet Enterprise that Puppet Labs still supports will have\nbugfix maintenance branches periodically &quot;merged up&quot; into master.  The current\nlist of integration branches are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>v2.1.x (v2.1.1 released in PE 1.2, 1.2.1, 1.2.3, 1.2.4)</li>\n<li>v2.2.x (Never released as part of PE, only to the Forge)</li>\n<li>v2.3.x (Scheduled for next PE feature release)</li>\n<li>master (mainline development branch)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first Puppet Enterprise version including the stdlib module is Puppet\nEnterprise 1.2.</p>\n\n<h1>Compatibility</h1>\n\n<h2>stdlib v2.1.x, v2.2.x</h2>\n\n<p>v2.1.x and v2.2.x of this module are designed to work with Puppet versions\n2.6.x and 2.7.x.  There are currently no plans for a Puppet 0.25 standard\nlibrary module.</p>\n\n<h2>stdlib v2.3.x</h2>\n\n<p>While not yet released, the standard library may only work with Puppet 2.7.x.</p>\n\n<h1>Functions</h1>\n\n<p>Please see <code>puppet doc -r function</code> for documentation on each function.  The\n  current list of functions is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>getvar</li>\n<li>has_key</li>\n<li>loadyaml</li>\n<li>merge.rb</li>\n<li>validate_array</li>\n<li>validate_bool</li>\n<li>validate_hash</li>\n<li>validate_re</li>\n<li>validate_string</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>validate_hash</h2>\n\n<pre><code>$somehash = { &#39;one&#39; =&gt; &#39;two&#39; }\nvalidate\\_hash($somehash)\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>getvar()</h2>\n\n<p>This function aims to look up variables in user-defined namespaces within\npuppet.  Note, if the namespace is a class, it should already be evaluated\nbefore the function is used.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$namespace = &#39;site::data&#39;\ninclude &quot;${namespace}&quot;\n$myvar = getvar(&quot;${namespace}::myvar&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Facts</h2>\n\n<p>Facts in <code>/etc/facter/facts.d</code> and <code>/etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d</code> are now loaded\nautomatically.

This modules will include the following additions to Puppet</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stages</li>\n<li>Facts</li>\n<li>Functions</li>\n<li>Defined resource types</li>\n<li>Types</li>\n<li>Providers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This module is officially curated and provided by Puppet Labs.  The modules\nPuppet Labs writes and distributes will make heavy use of this standard\nlibrary.</p>\n\n<h1>Compatibility</h1>\n\n<p>This module is designed to work with Puppet version 2.6 and later.  It may be\nforked if Puppet 2.7 specific features are added.  There are currently no plans\nfor a Puppet 0.25 standard library module.</p>\n\n<h1>Functions</h1>\n\n<p>Please see <code>puppet doc -r function</code> for documentation on each function.  The\n  current list of functions is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>getvar</li>\n<li>has_key</li>\n<li>loadyaml</li>\n<li>merge.rb</li>\n<li>validate_array</li>\n<li>validate_bool</li>\n<li>validate_hash</li>\n<li>validate_re</li>\n<li>validate_string</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>validate_hash</h2>\n\n<pre><code>$somehash = { &#39;one&#39; =&gt; &#39;two&#39; }\nvalidate\\_hash($somehash)\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>getvar()</h2>\n\n<p>This function aims to look up variables in user-defined namespaces within\npuppet.  Note, if the namespace is a class, it should already be evaluated\nbefore the function is used.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$namespace = &#39;site::data&#39;\ninclude &quot;${namespace}&quot;\n$myvar = getvar(&quot;${namespace}::myvar&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n</section>",

This interacts badly\n  with the pattern of composing complex modules from smaller classes, as it\n  makes it impossible for end users to specify order relationships between the\n  exterior class and other modules.\n\n  The anchor type lets you work around this. By sandwiching any interior\n  classes between two no-op resources that _are_ contained by the exterior\n  class, you can ensure that all resources in the module are contained.\n\n      class ntp {\n        # These classes will have the correct order relationship with each\n        # other. However, without anchors, they won't have any order\n        # relationship to Class['ntp'].\n        class { 'ntp::package': }\n        -> class { 'ntp::config': }\n        -> class { 'ntp::service': }\n\n        # These two resources \"anchor\" the composed classes within the ntp\n        # class.\n        anchor { 'ntp::begin': } -> Class['ntp::package']\n        Class['ntp::service']    -> anchor { 'ntp::end': }\n      }\n\n  This allows the end user of the ntp module to establish require and before\n  relationships with Class['ntp']:\n\n      class { 'ntp': } -> class { 'mcollective': }\n      class { 'mcollective': } -> class { 'ntp': }\n\n"

This modules will include the following additions to Puppet</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stages</li>\n<li>Facts</li>\n<li>Functions</li>\n<li>Defined resource types</li>\n<li>Types</li>\n<li>Providers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This module is officially curated and provided by Puppet Labs.  The modules\nPuppet Labs writes and distributes will make heavy use of this standard\nlibrary.</p>\n\n<h1>Versions</h1>\n\n<p>This module follows semver.org (v1.0.0) versioning guidelines.  The standard\nlibrary module is released as part of <a href=\"http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-enterprise/\">Puppet\nEnterprise</a> and as a result\nolder versions of Puppet Enterprise that Puppet Labs still supports will have\nbugfix maintenance branches periodically &quot;merged up&quot; into master.  The current\nlist of integration branches are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>v2.1.x (v2.1.1 released in PE 1.2, 1.2.1, 1.2.3, 1.2.4)</li>\n<li>v2.2.x (Never released as part of PE, only to the Forge)</li>\n<li>v2.3.x (Scheduled for next PE feature release)</li>\n<li>master (mainline development branch)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first Puppet Enterprise version including the stdlib module is Puppet\nEnterprise 1.2.</p>\n\n<h1>Compatibility</h1>\n\n<h2>stdlib v2.1.x, v2.2.x</h2>\n\n<p>v2.1.x and v2.2.x of this module are designed to work with Puppet versions\n2.6.x and 2.7.x.  There are currently no plans for a Puppet 0.25 standard\nlibrary module.</p>\n\n<h2>stdlib v2.3.x</h2>\n\n<p>While not yet released, the standard library may only work with Puppet 2.7.x.</p>\n\n<h1>Functions</h1>\n\n<p>Please see <code>puppet doc -r function</code> for documentation on each function.  The\n  current list of functions is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>getvar</li>\n<li>has_key</li>\n<li>loadyaml</li>\n<li>merge.rb</li>\n<li>validate_array</li>\n<li>validate_bool</li>\n<li>validate_hash</li>\n<li>validate_re</li>\n<li>validate_string</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>validate_hash</h2>\n\n<pre><code>$somehash = { &#39;one&#39; =&gt; &#39;two&#39; }\nvalidate\\_hash($somehash)\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>getvar()</h2>\n\n<p>This function aims to look up variables in user-defined namespaces within\npuppet.  Note, if the namespace is a class, it should already be evaluated\nbefore the function is used.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$namespace = &#39;site::data&#39;\ninclude &quot;${namespace}&quot;\n$myvar = getvar(&quot;${namespace}::myvar&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Facts</h2>\n\n<p>Facts in <code>/etc/facter/facts.d</code> and <code>/etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d</code> are now loaded\nautomatically.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets &quot;[]&quot;\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
